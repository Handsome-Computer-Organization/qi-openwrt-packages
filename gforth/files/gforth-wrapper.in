  Gforth image $GFORTH_FI 
  is missing and regeneration failed:

  '$dirname/gforth-update-image' 
  aborted with  exit code $status.

  Try to re-run 'gforth-update-image'  manually to
  see what is wrong.  Also  please report this 
  problem to  <discussion@lists.qi-hardware.com>
  and/or <dvdkhlng ta gmx tod de>.

  As a workaround, you can run a kernel-only Gforth
  (with reduced functionality), using:

  $binary -i @kernel_fi@
EOF

  exec false
}

if ! [ -f "$GFORTH_FI" ]; then
    do_update
fi

# if everything is ok, we'll come here and run the actual Gforth executable
# (gforth.real, gforth-fast.real etc.)
exec "$binary" "$@"
